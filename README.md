# inf-clojure

This package provides basic interaction with a Clojure subprocess (REPL).
It's based on ideas from the popular `inferior-lisp` package.

`inf-clojure` has two components - a nice Clojure REPL with
auto-completion and a minor mode (`inf-clojure-minor-mode`), which
extends `clojure-mode` with commands to evaluate forms directly in the
REPL.

For a more powerful/full-featured solution see [CIDER][].

## Installation

Available on all major `package.el` community maintained repos -
[MELPA Stable][] and [MELPA][] repos.

MELPA Stable is recommended as it has the latest stable version.
MELPA has a development snapshot for users who don't mind breakage but
don't want to run from a git checkout.

You can install `inf-clojure` using the following command:

<kbd>M-x package-install [RET] inf-clojure [RET]</kbd>

or if you'd rather keep it in your dotfiles:

```el
(unless (package-installed-p 'inf-clojure)
  (package-refresh-contents)
  (package-install 'inf-clojure))
```

If the installation doesn't work try refreshing the package list:

<kbd>M-x package-refresh-contents</kbd>

Add the following to your Emacs config to enable
`inf-clojure-minor-mode` for Clojure source buffers:

```el
(add-hook 'clojure-mode-hook #'inf-clojure-minor-mode)
```

**Don't enable `inf-clojure-minor-mode` and `cider-mode` at the same
time.  They have overlapping functionality and keybindings and the
result will be nothing short of havoc.**

## Usage

`M-x inf-clojure` or `C-c C-z` within a Clojure source file.

`inf-clojure-program` is a custom variable that defines a program to run
or the tcp socket to connect to when starting `inf-clojure`. By default
this variable is set to `lein repl`, which will start a REPL via Leiningen.
However, it is possible to use a cons pair like `("localhost" . 5555)` to
connect to a socket REPL like the one provided with [planck](http://planck-repl.org/),
which can be started from the command line with `planck -n 5555`.

Use `C-u C-c C-z` to start a REPL with a different command/cons pair than
the default specified in `inf-clojure-program`.

## ElDoc

`eldoc-mode` is supported in Clojure source buffers and `*inferior-clojure*`
buffers which are running a Clojure REPL.

When ElDoc is enabled and there is an active REPL, it will show the
argument list of the function call you are currently editing in the
echo area.

You can activate ElDoc with `M-x eldoc-mode` or by adding the
following to you Emacs config:

```el
(add-hook 'clojure-mode-hook #'eldoc-mode)
(add-hook 'inf-clojure-mode-hook #'eldoc-mode)
```

ElDoc currently doesn't work with ClojureScript buffers and REPL's.
You can leave it enabled, it just won't show anything in the echo area.

## Troubleshooting

### REPL not responsive in Windows OS

In Windows, the REPL is not returning anything. For example, type `(+
1 1)` and press `ENTER`, the cursor just drops to a new line and
nothing is shown.

The explanation of this problem and solution can be found [here](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/leiningen/48M-xvcI2Ng).

The solution is to create a file named `.jline.rc` in your `$HOME`
directory and add this line to that file:

```
jline.terminal=unsupported
```
