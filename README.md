# inf-clojure

This package provides basic interaction with a Clojure subprocess (REPL).
It's based on ideas from the popular `inferior-lisp` package.

`inf-clojure` has two components - a nice Clojure REPL with
auto-completion and a minor mode (`inf-clojure-minor-mode`), which
extends `clojure-mode` with commands to evaluate forms directly in the
REPL.

`inf-clojure` provides a set of essential features for interactive
Clojure(Script) development:

* REPL
* Interactive code evaluation
* Code completion
* Definition lookup
* Documentation lookup
* ElDoc
* Apropos
* Macroexpansion
* Support connecting to socket REPLs
* Support for Lumo
* Support for Planck

For a more powerful/full-featured solution see [CIDER][].

## Installation

Available on all major `package.el` community maintained repos -
[MELPA Stable][] and [MELPA][] repos.

MELPA Stable is recommended as it has the latest stable version.
MELPA has a development snapshot for users who don't mind breakage but
don't want to run from a git checkout.

You can install `inf-clojure` using the following command:

<kbd>M-x package-install [RET] inf-clojure [RET]</kbd>

or if you'd rather keep it in your dotfiles:

```el
(unless (package-installed-p 'inf-clojure)
  (package-refresh-contents)
  (package-install 'inf-clojure))
```

If the installation doesn't work try refreshing the package list:

<kbd>M-x package-refresh-contents</kbd>

Add the following to your Emacs config to enable
`inf-clojure-minor-mode` for Clojure source buffers:

```el
(add-hook 'clojure-mode-hook #'inf-clojure-minor-mode)
```

**Don't enable `inf-clojure-minor-mode` and `cider-mode` at the same
time.  They have overlapping functionality and keybindings and the
result will be nothing short of havoc.**

## Usage

Just invoke `M-x inf-clojure` or press `C-c C-z` within a Clojure source file.
This will start a REPL process for the current project and you can start
interacting with it.

`inf-clojure` has several custom variables which control the command
used to start a REPL for particular project type - `inf-clojure-lein-cmd`,
`inf-clojure-boot-cmd` and `inf-clojure-generic-cmd`.

By default all those variables are set to strings (e.g. `lein repl`).
However, it is possible to use a cons pair like `("localhost" . 5555)`
to connect to a socket REPL like the one provided
with [planck](http://planck-repl.org/), which can be started from the
command line with `planck -n 5555`.

Use `C-u C-c C-z` to start a REPL with a different command/cons pair than
the default specified in `inf-clojure-program`.

You can use `M-x inf-clojure-connect` to connect to a running socket-repl.
You will be prompted for host and port.

You can set custom values to `inf-clojure` variables on a per-project basis using [directory
variables](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Directory-Variables.html).

For a list of all available commands in `inf-clojure-mode` (a.k.a. the REPL) and
`inf-clojure-minor-mode` you can either invoke `C-h f RET inf-clojure-mode` and
`C-h f RET inf-clojure-minor-mode` or simply browse their menus.

Many `inf-clojure-minor-mode` commands by default act on the symbol at
point. You can, however, change this behaviour by invoking such
commands with a prefix argument. For instance: `C-u C-c C-v` will ask
for the symbol you want to show the docstring for.

#### Caveats

Note that if you decide _NOT_ to use the socket repl, it is highly recommended
you disable output coloring and/or readline facilities: `inf-clojure` does not
filter out ASCII escape characters at the moment and will not behave correctly.

You can disable coloring the following way for `boot`:

```el
((nil . ((inf-clojure-boot-cmd . "boot repl -C"))))
```

For leiningen, there are no command line switches and you need to add a custom [`project.clj` option](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen/blob/master/sample.project.clj):

```clojure
...
  :repl-options {:color false}
...
```

## Configuration options

In the time-honoured Emacs tradition `inf-clojure`'s behaviour is extremely
configurable.

You can see all the configuration options available using the command
`M-x customize-group RET inf-clojure`.

## REPL Type

An `inf-clojure` REPL can be of different types: Clojure,
ClojureScript, Lumo and Planck are all potentially valid options.  At
the moment, the default Clojure REPL, the Lumo REPL (though partially,
see https://github.com/clojure-emacs/inf-clojure/pull/44), and the
Planck REPL are supported.

What does it mean that a REPL type is supported - well it means that `inf-clojure`
would use the proper code internally to power commands like definition lookup and friends.
Those differ from REPL to REPL and can't be implemented in a REPL-independent way. At
boot type `inf-clojure` tries to detect the type of the REPL that was started and uses
this type to dispatch the proper code for the respective REPL type.

By default `inf-clojure` would start a standard Clojure REPL using
`lein` or `boot` but you can easily change this.  To boot some other REPL just use the
right launch command (or connect to the REPL via a socket).  For example, for
Lumo just add the following in your `.dir-locals.el`:

```el
((nil . ((inf-clojure-boot-cmd . "lumo -d")))) ;; inf-clojure-lein-cmd if you are using Leiningen
```

## ElDoc

`eldoc-mode` is supported in Clojure source buffers and `*inferior-clojure*`
buffers which are running a Clojure REPL.

When ElDoc is enabled and there is an active REPL, it will show the
argument list of the function call you are currently editing in the
echo area.

You can activate ElDoc with `M-x eldoc-mode` or by adding the
following to you Emacs config:

```el
(add-hook 'clojure-mode-hook #'eldoc-mode)
(add-hook 'inf-clojure-mode-hook #'eldoc-mode)
```

ElDoc currently doesn't work with ClojureScript buffers and REPL's.
You can leave it enabled, it just won't show anything in the echo area.

## Lumo Setup

For an optimal Lumo experience the `-d` needs to be passed to Lumo
when launched from the command line. This disable `readline` support
in order to play nicely with emacs.

For example, you can use the following command (assuming `cp` contains
the classpath) in your `.dir-locals.el`:

```el
((nil . (eval . (setq inf-clojure-boot-cmd (concat "lumo -d -c "
                                                    (f-read (concat (inf-clojure-project-root) "cp")))))))
```

## Troubleshooting

### REPL not responsive in Windows OS

In Windows, the REPL is not returning anything. For example, type `(+
1 1)` and press `ENTER`, the cursor just drops to a new line and
nothing is shown.

The explanation of this problem and solution can be found [here](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/leiningen/48M-xvcI2Ng).

The solution is to create a file named `.jline.rc` in your `$HOME`
directory and add this line to that file:

```
jline.terminal=unsupported
```
